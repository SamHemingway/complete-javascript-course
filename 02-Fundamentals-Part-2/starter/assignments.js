'use strict';

// LECTURE: Functions

// 1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters: 'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its capital city is Helsinki'.

function describeCountry(country, population, capitalCity) {
	return `${country} has ${population} million people and its capital city is ${capitalCity}.`;
}

// 2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console 

const country1 = describeCountry('Canada', 38, 'Ottawa');
const country2 = describeCountry('England', 56, 'London');
const country3 = describeCountry('France', 67, 'Paris');

// console.log(country1, country2, country3);

// LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions

// 1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.
// 2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900 and then multiply by 100

function percentageOfWorld1(population) {
	return population / 7900 * 100;
} 
// 
// // 3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console
// 
// const countryPopulationPercentage1 = percentageOfWorld1(38);
// const countryPopulationPercentage2 = percentageOfWorld1(56);
// const countryPopulationPercentage3 = percentageOfWorld1(67);
// 
// console.log(countryPopulationPercentage1, countryPopulationPercentage2, countryPopulationPercentage3);
// 
// // 4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called 'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations)
// 
// const percentageOfWorld2 = function(population) {
// 	return population / 7900 * 100;
// } 
// 
// const countryPopulationPercentage1B = percentageOfWorld2(38);
// const countryPopulationPercentage2B = percentageOfWorld2(56);
// const countryPopulationPercentage3B = percentageOfWorld2(67);
// 
// console.log(countryPopulationPercentage1B, countryPopulationPercentage2B, countryPopulationPercentage3B);

// LECTURE: Arrow Functions

// 1. Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function called 'percentageOfWorld3'

// const percentageOfWorld3 = (population) => population / 7900 * 100;

// LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions

// 1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and 'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people, which is about 18.2% of the world.'
// 2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the 'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier

function describePopulation(country, population) {
	return `${country} has ${population} million people, which is about ${percentageOfWorld1(population)}% of the world`
}

// 3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice

describePopulation('Canada', 38);
describePopulation('England', 56);
describePopulation('France', 67);

// LECTURE: Introduction to Arrays

// 1. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice. You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a variable called 'populations'

let populations = [28, 56, 67, 102];

// 2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)

// console.log(populations.length === 4)

// 3. Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the world population for these 4 population values. Use the function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4 percentage values

let percentages = [
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[0]),
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[1]),
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[2]),
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[3]),
  ]
  
// LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods)

//   1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
//   choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
//   into a variable called 'neighbours'

const neighbours = ['Albania', 'North Macedonia', 'Bulgaria', 'Turkey'];

//   2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
//   your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array

neighbours.push('Utopia');

//   3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
//   the end of the array

neighbours.pop();

//   4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the
//   console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'

// if (!neighbours.includes('Germany')) {
// 	console.log(`Probably not a central European country :D`)
// }

//   5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
//   index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
//   change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
//   'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

const indexPosition = neighbours.indexOf('North Macedonia');
neighbours[indexPosition] = 'South Macedonia';

// LECTURE: Introduction to Objects

// 1. Create an object called 'myCountry' for a country of your choice, containing
// properties 'country', 'capital', 'language', 'population' and
// 'neighbours' (an array like we used in previous assignments)

const myCountry = {
	country: 'Greece',
	capital: 'Athens',
	language: 'Greek',
	population: 10.72,
	neighbours: ['Albania', 'North Macedonia', 'Bulgaria', 'Turkey'],
}

// LECTURE: Dot vs. Bracket Notation

// 1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
// console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
// and a capital called Helsinki.'

// console.log(`${myCountry.country} has ${myCountry.population} million ${myCountry.language} speaking people, ${myCountry.neighbours.length} neighbouring countries and a capital called ${myCountry.capital}.`)

// 2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
// decrease it by two million using brackets notation.

myCountry.population += 2;
// console.log(myCountry.population);
myCountry['population'] -= 2;
// console.log(myCountry.population);

// LECTURE: Object Methods

// 1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method
// will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
// assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.

myCountry.describe = function() {
	const result = `${this.country} has ${this.population} million ${this.language} speaking people, ${this.neighbours.length} neighbouring countries and a capital called ${this.capital}.`
	
	myCountry.description = result;
	// console.log(result);
	return result;
}

// 2. Call the 'describe' method

myCountry.describe();

// 3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
// method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
// 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if
// there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.

myCountry.checkIsland = () => myCountry.isIsland = myCountry.neighbours ? false : true;

// LECTURE: Iteration: The for Loop

// 1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters.
// Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to
// the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'

for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
	// console.log(`Voter number ${i} is currently voting.`);
}

// LECTURE: Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing

// 1. Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment
// 2. Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the
// percentages of the world population for the 4 population values. Use the
// function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier

const percentages2 = [];

for (let i = 0; i < populations.length; i++) {
	percentages2.push(percentageOfWorld1(populations[i]));
}

// console.log(percentages2);

// LECTURE: Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops

// 1. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
// [['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden',
// 'Russia']];

const listOfNeighbours = [
	['Canada', 'Mexico'], 
	['Spain'], 
	['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Russia'],
];

// 2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire
// arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
// 3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't
// worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway ðŸ˜‰

for (let element of listOfNeighbours) {
	for (let country of element) {
		// console.log(country);
	}
}

// LECTURE: The while Loop

// 1. Recreate the challenge from the lecture 'Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing',
// but this time using a while loop (call the array 'percentages3')
// 2. Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the while
// loop?

const percentages3 = [];

while (percentages3.length < populations.length) {
	let i = 0;
	percentages3.push(percentageOfWorld1(populations[i]));
	i++;
}

// console.log(percentages3)
