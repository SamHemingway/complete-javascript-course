/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
*/

// 1. Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)

const bill = 430;

const tip = (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;

// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
// 
// console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value is ${bill + tip}.`);
